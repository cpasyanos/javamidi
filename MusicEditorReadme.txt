IPiece is the main interface, and this is what represents a “piece” of music. A piece of music is a list of beats, organized in ascending order beginning from one. The operations currently supported by IPiece are adding and removing a note, and every implementation of IPiece uses the toString method to produce console output of the piece of music. This output shows the range of notes across the top. The beats are listed down the side, with the beginning of the note marked by an X, and the rest of the note marked by a |.
Beats hold an arraylist of all of the notes that begin at that beat and a number that that beat is at. Notes cannot be added to that beat unless they begin at the beat. Notes in a beat are sorted in ascending order with the lowest notes at the front of the list and the highest at the end.
Notes have a duration, a beginning beat, an octave, and a pitch. Notes implement the Comparable interface so that a list of notes may be sorted in ascending order in terms of lowest to highest note. The compareTo method does not care about the duration or start beat of the note.
